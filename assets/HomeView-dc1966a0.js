A simple menu to navigate between the two routes should be always visible When a route is loaded, the application should make an API call to obtain a JSON object that describes a form to be rendered in the view. The JSON objects downloaded via API calls should be saved in a pin ia storage, and subsequently loaded from storage instead Of using an HTTP call if the same route is loaded again in the same session TypeScript should be used if possible, but it&#39;s Okay to use JavaScript if you re not experienced with TypeScript. Attached are: — two JSON files to simulate API calls via fetch; — a sample design for the form (it doesn&#39;t need to be pixel—perfect, serves as an indication of style). </p><h6 class="text-center sub-title">Mock Provided</h6><div class="d-flex justify-content-center"><img src="'+n+'" class="mockup-image" alt=""></div></div>',1),r=[d];function l(u,p,m,h,f,b){return s(),o("div",c,r)}const v=t(i,[["render",l]]);export{v as default};
